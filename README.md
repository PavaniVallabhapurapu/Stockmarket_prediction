#Stock market prediction involves using historical data, statistical models, and machine learning techniques to forecast future stock prices and market trends. It analyzes factors like price movements, trading volume, economic indicators, and news sentiment to predict stock performance. While predictions can provide insights, market fluctuations, external events, and investor behavior make it inherently uncertain.
